# Yolo-Tiny-Face-Classification-Keras
This is a Yolo Implementation of the Tiny Darknet architecture for Face Classification and Detection in Keras.The model is trained on both the FDDB and the Wider Face Dataset. The Tiny Darknt Yolo model is less than 40MB and can predict object confidence, class confidence and bounding box offests in one signle run through the model.


The project is based on the repository from **qqwweee**, transplantd from:**https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3**
